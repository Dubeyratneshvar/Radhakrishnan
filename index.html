          <p>
            <b> Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan </b>(1888–1975) was an eminent
            Indian philosopher, scholar, and statesman. A prominent advocate of
            Indian philosophy, he bridged Eastern and Western thought through
            his influential works, including *"Indian Philosophy"* and *"The
            Hindu View of Life."* Radhakrishnan served as India's Vice-President
            from 1952 to 1962 and as President from 1962 to 1967, advocating for
            education and democratic values. His contributions to education and
            philosophy are celebrated annually on Teachers' Day in India, held
            on September 5, his birthday. Radhakrishnan's legacy continues to
            inspire respect for learning and intellectual pursuit.
